# Exercism JavaScript Track – Comprehensive Practice Repository

This repository contains my complete practice work and solutions from the **JavaScript track on Exercism**.

The purpose of this repository is not only to solve exercises, but to **systematically build a strong, production-ready understanding of JavaScript fundamentals** through constrained, test-driven problems.

## Scope of Learning

The Exercism JavaScript track covers a wide range of essential programming concepts. Through these exercises, I have practiced and reinforced the following areas:

### Core JavaScript Fundamentals
- Primitive data types and type coercion
- Variables, immutability, and reassignment
- Conditional logic and control flow
- Truthy and falsy values
- Equality and strict comparison

### Functions & Execution Model
- Function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions
- Parameters, default values, and rest parameters
- Return values and early returns
- Hoisting behavior
- Lexical scoping and closures
- Higher-order functions
- Function composition
- Recursion and iterative alternatives
- Memoization patterns

### Arrays & Iteration
- Array creation and indexing
- Iteration techniques (`for`, `for...of`, `forEach`)
- Array analysis methods (`includes`, `some`, `every`, `find`, `findIndex`)
- Array transformation methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- Destructuring assignment
- Spread and rest operators
- Working with array-like data structures

### Objects & Data Modeling
- Object creation and property access
- Dynamic keys and bracket notation
- Object destructuring and renaming
- Object mutation vs immutability
- Merging and extending objects
- Working with nested data
- Optional chaining (`?.`)
- Nullish coalescing (`??`)

### JavaScript Runtime & Language Mechanics
- Execution context and scope chain
- `this` keyword behavior in:
  - Object methods
  - Regular functions
  - Arrow functions
- Differences between `null` and `undefined`
- Side effects and state management
- Pure vs impure functions

### Problem Solving & Code Quality
- Translating problem statements into executable logic
- Designing data structures before implementation
- Identifying edge cases
- Writing readable, maintainable logic
- Avoiding over-engineering
- Understanding test-driven constraints

## Development Approach

- All solutions are written in **modern JavaScript (ES6+)**
- Focus is placed on correctness, clarity, and intent
- Exercises are solved without relying on external libraries
- Preference is given to explicit logic over clever shortcuts
- Code is iteratively improved as understanding deepens

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository represents a structured learning phase focused on mastering JavaScript fundamentals before transitioning fully into framework-based frontend development.

It serves as:
- A learning log
- A reference for core JavaScript concepts
- A foundation for future frontend and full-stack work
